Abstract: Despite the urgent need to preserve natural capital, little is known about the direct benefits people receive from it. To achieve the sustainable development goals, especially Goal 15: Life on Land, reliable benefit estimates are required to incorporate the value of natural capital in national capital accounting, cost-benefit analyses, project appraisal, and in international policy agreements. What is needed is a comprehensive, transferable, and spatially-consistent benefit estimation. However, the multiple, interlinked services produced from natural capital make it hard to estimate its benefits, explaining a lack of robust benefit estimates. Using a novel valuation approach, the study discloses the benefits of natural capital and biodiversity, spatially differentiated all over Europe. The study employs a spatial-explicit choice experiment approach, which estimates benefits people receive from natural capital conditional on the current status in their places of residence. The results are easily transferable to other regions and contexts and allow trading off the benefits and costs of restoring natural capital and biodiversity. It can be seen in which regions the loss of natural capital is critical and where measures are most effective. Aggregated values indicate the overall willingness to pay of European citizens to restore natural capital, for example by adopting sustainable agriculture or creating natural protected areas. Stakeholders who are interested in the value of natural capital and biodiversity can easily use and adapt the estimates for their purposes. The results enrich the discussion on the loss of natural capital and biodiversity and can significantly contribute to broader policy discussions in the context of the interlinked climate and biodiversity crises.

# Part A: General Information {.unnumbered}

## Background {.unnumbered}

Economic values of natural capital are useful for policy makers at different scales and for different purposes.
Its importance is manifested in several international efforts guiding how to estimate such values[^1], and how to use thus values in various contexts[^2]
. Uses of economic values of natural capital in policy making include welfare analyses, assessment of damages, cost-benefit analyses, stakeholder engagements and natural capital accounting
. While there is a large theoretical and empirical literature on valuation of natural capital, we still lack a holistic and consistent set of values of natural capital
. This study aims to provide values of natural capital, which benefit the overall aim of a holistic valuation
. Specifically, we derive spatially-explicit high resolution economic values of natural capital
. Using different valuation methods – choice experiments, life satisfaction, travel cost – we conduct a survey with spatially individual valuation tasks to estimate functions for values of protected natural areas and high nature value farmland
. Regarding the choice experiment, we have developed a new method to incorporate the current endowment of natural capital in the valuation task
. Survey participants are confronted with maps showing their current endowment and then make a choice between different policy scenarios
. The current endowment is calculated using European-wide GIS data on protected natural areas and high nature value farmland

Our approach allows us to derive high resolution maps with values all over Europe.
In our study, we present a novel approach in which high-resolution data from geographic information systems (GIS) are used directly in a discrete choice experiment.
We show respondents their status quo endowments with protected areas and high nature value farmland as well as proposed extensions to these areas on interactive maps.
Using an R algorithm and land cover data we ensure that all proposed changes are feasible.
With this unique technical feature of the discrete choice experiment, we enable the respondents to incorporate their endowment with natural capital around their place of residence in the decision process and ensure that all proposed landscape changes are feasible, visible, and relevant in distance to the respondents.
Further, we vary the accessibility of newly created protected areas, the visibility of the new high nature value farmland areas, and the distances to both of these new areas to partly disentangle the use and non-use values of these forms of natural capital.
Additionally, by incorporating socio-demographic and spatially explicit variables, we seek to identify how different populations and regions perceive substitutes and complements to natural capital.
The sample size of N = 15, 000 allows us to conduct an in-depth analysis of the major drivers in heterogeneity for preferences of natural capital.

## Key research questions {.unnumbered}

Our study contributes to the research on valuing natural capital, leading to two sets of different research questions.
First, we want to investigate the spatially-differentiated value of natural capital in Europe leading to the following set of research questions: What is the value of protected natural areas and high nature value farmland, and how does it differ across regions?
What are determinants (socio-demographics, landscape features, substitutes and complements of natural capital) of these values?
To what extent does the distance of natural capital impact its marginal value and welfare estimates?
To what extent do spatial endowments of protected areas and high nature value farmland affect its marginal value and welfare estimates?
What differences emerge between use-related values and non-use-related values?

Second, we want to investigate several methodical questions that are inherit to the current practice of choice experiments:

-   What are the implications of the usage of different specifications of the utility function (e.g. linear, quadratic, Box-Cox) on welfare estimates?

-   Does the scope (i.e. regional extent) of a measure to protect natural capital impact the value (scope and embedding effects)?

-   Are elicited values constant over different methods (choice experiment, travel cost method, life satisfaction)?

-   How do the distributional consequences of the payment vehicle impact choices and values?

-   How do different time horizons of the payment period impact choices and values?

-   In the context of recreation demand (travel cost) approach, how does survey formulation influence the respondent’s answers, and can targeted survey tools (e.g., interactive maps, timeline graph, calculation hints, feedback on reported numbers) improve recall and affect the obtained welfare estimates?

# Publication strategy

## The large dataset cannot be summarized and analyzed in one single paper. For different research questions, we plan to write different papers. The papers are listed here:

1. Spatial explicit valuation of natural capital in Germany and its transferibility: Implications for policy and benefit transfers

- In this paper, we estimate a spatial explicit utility function to capture local willingness to pay values for landscape changes. We derive a marginal willingness to pay function that contains spatial and socio-demographic variables. The willingness to pay function allows us to predict marginal willingness to pay on high resolution spatial units. Having a large set of observed values, we test how the marginal willingness to pay function predicts local marginal willingness to pay. We use several different utility specifications (quadratic, logaritmic, Cox-Box) and different predictor variables to empirically identify the best specification in terms of a) model fit and b) predictive power. 

2. The effect of scope, and distance stated preferences

The literature has impressively shown a lack of sensitivity to scope of stated preferences, while distance to the good to be valued plays a critically explain stated preferences. This paper investigates the effects of distance and scope simultaneously in a between-sample and within sample experiment. Scope is defined as the actual amount of the good to be valued, while distance is defined as the distance to the good to be valued as well as the quantity within distance.

4. The impact of nature relatedness on the economic value of natural capital

People who strongly relate to nature are likely more interested in measures to protect nature and derive higher utility from natural environments than people who less strongly relate to nature. At the same time, these people may more likely reject individual or collective payments to improve the natural environment and have other perceptions of the distribution of the costs to imrpove natural environments... blabla dont know

6. Life satisfaction ... i have no idea ... how satisfied are people with their lives in natural capital rich areas

7. Comparison of methods to estimate the implicit price of natural capital: Choice experiments, travel cost and life satisfaction

8. The effect of the distribution of costs on willingness to pay for natural capital

Despite the fact that people are willing to give up income in exchange for a better natural environment, several people state not to pay conditional on the actual distribution of the costs. Costs can be distributed in various ways. Richer people can be asked to pay more than poorer people, everyone can pay the same, those who benefit most can pay more, and those who create more damage pay more. This paper explores the acceptance of an individual payment for improvements on natural capital conditional on how the costs are distributed. We set up a theoretical model that models rejection of a specific payment as an argument in the utility function...
